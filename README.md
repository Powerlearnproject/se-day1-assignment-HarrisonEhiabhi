#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is basically the systematical application of various engineering principles,methods and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software system.
and its importance to technology industry can be seen in different ways;
1.improved productivity : creativity rate is heightened with the speed and the efficiency of it output
2.cost saving :software engineering reduces cost by minimizing errors,rework and maintenance
3.innovation : Software engineering enables innovation by developing new software,solutions,products, and services
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. 1968: NATO Software Engineering conference which recognised software engineering as a distinct field, identified software crisis, led to the establishment of software engineering as a discipline.
2. 1987: introduction of object-oriented Programming (OOP) which revolutionalised software designs and development, enabled more efficient, modular, and reusable code.
3. 2001: Agile manifesto: This introduced iterative, customer-centric, and flexible development approaches and popularized Agile methodologies like Scrum, Kanban, and Lean.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
SDLC:
1.Planning:This involves defining project scope, goals and deliverables
2.Requirements gathering: This process involves collecting and documenting software requirements
3.Analysis: This process involves the breakdown of complex requirements into smaller components
4. Designs: This process involves the development of user interface(UI) and user experience(UX)designs and creation of a detailed software designs and architecture.
5.Implementation(coding) : this involves the writing and testing of individual software component.
6.Testing: Planning and execution of various testing types (e.g, system,acceptance,regression)
7.Deployment: this process involves planning and execution of software deployment
8.Maintenance: This process involves providing ongoing support and bug fixing
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
COMPARISONS
** WATERFALL METHODOLOGY**

-Emphasizes predictability, stability and control
**AGILE METHODOLOGY**
-Iterative, flexible approach
-Phases: Planning, Sprint1, Sprint2.......Review Retrospective.
-Emphasizes adaptability, colloboration and continuous improvement.
-Changes are accommodated through regular iteration and feedback.
EXAMPLES OF SCENARIOS
-Waterfall: Developing a banking system with strict regulatory requirements.
-Agile: Creating a new mobile app with evolving user needs and feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPER
-Design, develop, test and maintain software applications 
-Write, clean,efficient and well documented code.
-Troubleshoot and debug software issues 
-stay up to date with industry trends and emerging technologies
QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER
-Develop and execute comprehensive testing plans to ensure software quality
-Develop and maintain automated testing scripts and framework.
-Ensure compliance with industry standards and testing methodologies.
PROJECT MANAGER
-Identify and mitigate project risk and issues 
-Ensure adherence to project management methodologies and framework e.g Agile and waterfall
-Develop and manage project plans, schedules, and budgets
-Define project scope, goals, timelines, and resource allocation

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS:
An IDE is a software appliction that provides a comprehensive development environment, offering features such as:
-code editing and syntax hihlighting
-Project navigation and organization
-Debugging and testing tools
-code completion and refactoring
EXAMPLES OF IDE
-Eclipse
-Visual studio
-IntelliJ IDEA
-NetBEANS
-PyCharm

VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS 
A VCS is a system that helps manage changes to a code, document, or other digital content overtime, offering features such as:
-Versioning and change tracking 
-Branching and Merging
-Collaboration and access control
-Backup and recovery
EXAMPLES OF VCS:
-Git
-Subversion(SVN)
-Mercurial
-Perforce
-CVS

IMPORTANCE IDE AND VCS:
-Improved productivity and efficiency 
-Enhanced collaboration and teamwork 
-Better code organization and management 
-Version control and change tracking 
-Easier debugging and testing 
-Faster development and deployment

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.    
                CHALLENGES               -                STRATEGIES TO OVERCOME
1.COMPLEXITY                                          BREAKDOWN COMPLEX TASKS 
2.TIME CONSTRAINTS                                    AGILE METHODOLOGIES:adopt iterative development approaches like Scrum or Kabnban
3.CHANGING REQUIREMENTS                               CONTINUOUS LEARNING 
4.TECHNICAL DEBT                                       CODE REFACTORING

6.COMMUNICATION HASSLE                                CLEAR COMMUNICATION
7.BURN OUT                                             SELF-CARE
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
UNIT TESTING:Tests individual code components or units to ensure they work correctly.
IMPORTANCE:Ensures individual components are reliable and function as expected 

INTEGRATION TESTING: Tests how different units work together to ensure seamless integration.
IMPORTANCE: Identifies issues whne components interac, ensuring a cohesive system

SYSTEM TESTING: Tests the entire software system to ensure it meets requirements.
IMPORTANCE: Verifies the system overall functionality and performance

ACCEPTANCE TESTING: Tests the software to ensure it meets the customers requirements.
IMPORTANCE:Ensures the software meets the customers needs and expectations.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing,optimizing and refining natural language prompts to interact with Artificial intelligence(AI) systems, such as language mpodels, chat box or other machine learning model.
Prompt engineering is basically like creating a recipe for your robot which in otherhand directs the robot on what to do by the given instructuions.
the goal of Prompt engineering is to elicit specific,accurate, and relevant responses from the AI system, while minimizing errors, ambiguities or misinterpretations.

IMPORTANCE OF PROMPT ENGINEERING INTERACTING WITH AI MODELS
-Accurate responses:effective prompts elicit accurate and relevant responses from the AI, saving time and resources
-Clear communication: well-designed prompt ensure that the AI understands the users instant misunderstandings or misiterpretation
-Reducing bias and errors: Carefully crafted prompts can minimize AI biases and errors leading to more reliable and trustworthy outputs.
-Contextual understanding: Prompts provide contexts, Enabling AI to understand the topic, scope and requirements of the task.
-Improved efficiency: Optimized prompt streamline interactions, reducing the need for repeated queries or clarifications.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
 VAGUE PROMPT:Tell me about artificial intelligence"
 IMPROVED PROMPT:"Explain the current state and applications of artificial intelligence in natural language processing,including its limitations and potential future developments"

 The improved prompt is clearer and articulate because;
 1. Specifies the aspect of AI to focus on (natural language processing)
 2. Request a specific type of information (current state,applications, limitations, and future developments)
 3. Provides context for the desired level of detail.

As we explained earlier the aid of improved Prompt gives clarity to the AI model and helps it understand the users intent and provides a more accurate and relevant response.
